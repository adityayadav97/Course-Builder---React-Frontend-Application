Install Dependencies:

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to install all necessary node modules:
                npm install


Start the Application:

Once the installation is complete, start the application by executing:
                npm start


Initial Data Load:

The application uses json-server, hosted on Render, to store data. This setup ensures data persistence across page refreshes.
After starting the application, it may take a few seconds for the data to load. This is due to the data being fetched from the remote server.
Please wait a moment for the data to appear and the functionalities to become fully operational.


Note:
The deployment of json-server on Render might introduce a brief delay during the initial data load. This ensures that your data remains intact and persistent even after refreshing the page.
